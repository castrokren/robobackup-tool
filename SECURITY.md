# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security practices and policies for the RoboBackup Tool project. We are committed to maintaining a secure development environment and producing secure software artifacts.

## Security Framework

### SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts)

This project implements **SLSA Level 2** compliance, which includes:

- ✅ **Tamper-resistant build process**
- ✅ **Security verification**
- ✅ **Provenance generation**
- ✅ **Artifact verification**

### Security Scans

We perform the following security scans on every build:

1. **Bandit** - Python security linter for common vulnerabilities
2. **Safety** - Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
3. **Semgrep** - Advanced static analysis for security issues, secrets, and OWASP Top 10
4. **pip-audit** - Scans for vulnerable dependencies

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

We generate a complete Software Bill of Materials for every release using CycloneDX format in both JSON and XML formats.

## Vulnerability Management

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate action required, no exceptions
- **High**: Must be addressed within 24 hours
- **Medium**: Must be addressed within 1 week
- **Low**: Should be addressed within 1 month

### Vulnerability Response

1. **Detection**: Automated scans detect vulnerabilities
2. **Assessment**: Security team assesses impact and severity
3. **Remediation**: Development team fixes the vulnerability
4. **Verification**: Security team verifies the fix
5. **Documentation**: Changes are documented

### Allowed Exceptions

Exceptions to vulnerability policies require:
- Documented justification
- Security team approval
- Maximum 30-day duration
- Regular review and updates

## Dependency Management

### Blocked Packages

The following packages are blocked due to known vulnerabilities:

- `requests < 2.25.0` (CVE-2021-33503)
- `urllib3 < 1.26.0` (CVE-2021-33503)

### Update Process

1. **Automated Detection**: Tools detect outdated dependencies
2. **Security Review**: Security team reviews for vulnerabilities
3. **Testing**: Changes are tested in development environment
4. **Approval**: Security team approves the update
5. **Deployment**: Updates are deployed with monitoring

## Code Security

### Banned Patterns

The following patterns are banned and will cause build failures:

- Hardcoded passwords: `password.*=.*['\"].*['\"]`
- Hardcoded API keys: `api_key.*=.*['\"].*['\"]`
- Hardcoded secrets: `secret.*=.*['\"].*['\"]`

### Required Practices

- All code must pass static analysis
- Secrets scanning is mandatory
- OWASP Top 10 compliance is required
- Code reviews are mandatory for all changes

## Access Control

### Privileged Operations

The following operations require approval:

- **Service Installation**: Windows service installation requires security team approval
- **File System Access**: File system operations require logging

### Review Process

- All code changes require review
- Security changes require security team review
- Service-related changes require additional approval

## Compliance Frameworks

### SLSA Level 2

- Tamper-resistant build process
- Security verification
- Provenance generation
- Artifact verification

### OWASP Top 10 (2021)

We address the following OWASP controls:

- A01:2021 - Broken Access Control
- A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures
- A03:2021 - Injection
- A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
- A06:2021 - Vulnerable Components

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework

We implement the following NIST controls:

- ID.AM-1: Physical devices and systems
- ID.AM-2: Software platforms and applications
- ID.AM-3: Organizational communication and data flows
- PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials
- PR.AC-2: Physical access control
- PR.AC-3: Remote access
- PR.AC-4: Access permissions
- PR.AC-5: Network integrity
- PR.AC-6: Identities proofing and binding
- PR.AC-7: Users, devices, and other assets

## Incident Response

### Security Incidents

| Incident Type | Response Time | Escalation | Notification |
|---------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Critical Vulnerability | 4 hours | Immediate | Security Team, Management |
| High Vulnerability | 24 hours | Within 24h | Security Team |
| Secrets Exposure | 1 hour | Immediate | Security Team, Management |

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Automated tools or manual discovery
2. **Assessment**: Impact and severity evaluation
3. **Containment**: Immediate containment measures
4. **Eradication**: Root cause removal
5. **Recovery**: System restoration
6. **Lessons Learned**: Process improvement

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Security Metrics

We track the following metrics:

- **Vulnerability Count**: By severity level
- **Security Scan Coverage**: Percentage of code covered
- **SBOM Completeness**: Completeness of Software Bill of Materials

### Reporting

- Weekly security reports to security and development teams
- Monthly compliance reports to management
- Quarterly security reviews
