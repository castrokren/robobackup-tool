# Cursor Agent Rules
- Always produce **unified diffs** instead of rewriting full files.
- Only modify files explicitly mentioned in the request.
- After changes:
  - Run `eslint` and `prettier` (JS/TS)
  - Or `black` and `flake8` (Python)
- Follow **Conventional Commit** format:
  - feat: for new features
  - fix: for bug fixes
  - refactor: for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- Prefer minimal, targeted changes unless told otherwise.
- If unclear on a request, **ask clarifying questions before coding**.
