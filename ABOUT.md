- **Configuration Security**: All sensitive configuration data is encrypted

### Comprehensive Logging
- **Application Logs**: Detailed operation logs with different verbosity levels
- **Security Logs**: Audit trail for all security-related events
- **Robocopy Logs**: Integration with Robocopy's detailed logging
- **Error Logs**: Comprehensive error tracking and reporting

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance

### Enterprise Security
